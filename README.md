BizVizzAndroid
==============

Note for Android version: this is an early version, with only basic functionality.  If people find it useful, we will do our best to improve it.  One known issue is that the camera sometimes doesn't return a picture.  Try waiting a bit after taking the picture, and before accepting the picture, to give it a chance to catch up.  The reason this is being released so early is to support a RootStrikers.org day of action this Friday, May 17, 2013.  Getting money out of politics is too important to wait for all the bug fixes :)

BizVizz is corporate behavior made transparent and available to all. Just snap a picture of a brand’s logo or bar code and presto: a simple, graphic screen tells you the truth about America’s largest corporations. Taxes? Political donations? Subsidies? We’ve got the goods! Brought to you by the makers of the As Goes Janesville documentary.

Features:
✔ Snap a pic of a logo to instantly obtain corporate information
✔ Explore companies by tax rate, profits or keywords
✔ Get alerts about corporate accountability campaigns and other efforts you can join to make a difference
✔ Compare companies’ records to the rest of their industry
✔ 300 of America’s largest corporations representing over 900 brands included, and we’re growing
✔ Drill down to find the top recipients of a company’s campaign contributions

Whether you like to “shop your values”, you’re a concerned citizen, an activist, or a reporter on the economics beat, BizVizz is for you.

More than a "wikipedia" of corporate transparency, BizVizz makes it easy for you to get involved and DO something. We’ll alert you when there’s an action you can take — from signing a petition or joining a campaign to weighing in on legislation or accessing a new report. And everything in BizVizz can be quickly shared with your social networks so that your friends and colleagues can join in.

BizVizz is brought you to by the filmmakers behind the award-winning PBS|Independent Lens doc As Goes Janesville and their great partners: the Sundance doc We’re Not Broke, Citizens for Tax Justice, Good Jobs First, and the Sunlight Foundation. You can learn more about our key partners and others who've joined our effort once you download the app.
